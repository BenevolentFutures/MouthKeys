/// The floating shadow under a Datasheet surface (DESIGN.md §6, "floating shadow", Atin 2026-09-29):
/// a soft, neutral shadow that lifts the pill, a recovery card or the history card off the screen.
///
/// It is drawn in a panel of its own, a child panel ordered just below the surface's panel, so it
/// moves with it while shown. Two reasons:
/// - Click-through. A transparent panel takes a click wherever its pixels are not clear, so a
///   shadow painted in the surface's own panel would turn its transparent margin into a click
///   trap. This panel ignores mouse events from creation and is never toggled.
/// - The window server's own shadow (`hasShadow`) was tried first: it rims every painted pixel with
///   a dark hairline, shadows the hover brackets and the chips too, and cannot be tuned per
///   appearance.
///
/// The panel mirrors the surface panel's alpha (so alpha 0 casts nothing, and a card's fade takes
/// its shadow with it) and its frame plus `margin`. The owner reports the surface's rect and wraps
/// the shadow in the surface's own visibility, so it never outlives or precedes the surface.
///
/// A surface on the dictation start path (the pill) sets `presentsWithParent: false` and calls
/// `present()` a main-queue turn after it is shown and `withdraw()` once hidden, so showing the
/// pill moves and orders one window, never two; the shadow may arrive a frame late.
