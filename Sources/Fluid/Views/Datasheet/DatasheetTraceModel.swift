/// The voice trace's samples (DESIGN.md §4, §8). Levels arrive about 94 times a second.
///
/// Motion (Atin, 2026-09-29): the trace advances only while the voice is on, and smoothly.
/// - Voice-gated: a level above the gate (the calibrated quiet floor plus the Sensitivity share)
///   marks the voice on, and it stays on for a 250 ms hangover, so the trace does not stutter
///   between words. Only then does the advance clock run; in silence the trace holds still.
/// - Continuous: the advance clock pushes one bar every 83.3 ms (12 a second; round 6's 63 bars hold 5.25 s
///   of speech), and between pushes every bar slides left by the elapsed fraction of the 4 pt
///   pitch (`scrollFraction`), driven by the frame clock, instead of jumping a pitch at once.
/// - Eased: each drawn bar eases toward its target height (about 135 ms to settle), unsnapped;
///   the view snaps edges to device pixels, so bars stay square-ended and crisp.
/// The stop is as before: every bar to 2 pt over 60 ms, linear, and nothing moves after.
///
/// Heights are calibrated to the recording itself: a level draws by how far it rises above this
/// recording's quiet floor, scaled to its loud peak. A fixed gate (level 0.4, about -33 dBFS)
/// left a quiet microphone's speech at the 2 pt floor for whole dictations (Atin's fifine USB
/// microphone, 2026-09-29), while the frame clock, sampler and feed all ran. The floor and peak
/// follow real-time 83.3 ms windows whether or not the trace advances.
///
/// A plain reference type, not observed by SwiftUI: a level tick costs no view invalidation. The
/// trace's Canvas reads it from a `TimelineView` and drives `advance(to:)` from its frame clock.
/// Main actor only. Times are seconds since the reference date.
