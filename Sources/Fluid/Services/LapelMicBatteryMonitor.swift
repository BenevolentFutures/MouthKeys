/// it and every 30 s after. The 30 s timer runs for whatever input is selected, re-resolving it
/// each tick (two Core Audio property reads), so a receiver replugged or added to the aggregate is
/// picked up; the HID heartbeat goes out only on ticks where the input is the receiver. The main actor keeps the last reading with its time and sets
/// `DatasheetOverlayModel.micBattery` only when what the label shows changes; the overlay reads that
/// and nothing else. A reading older than 2 minutes reads as none. Under `TestHostQuietMode` it
/// does nothing at all, so no test ever opens a HID device.
